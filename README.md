<h2>Graph Homework for New Beginnings Winter 2018 Algorithms</h2>

1.  a) 1, 2, 9, 7, 3, 10, 5, 11, 8, 4, 6
    b) 1, 9, 2, 7, 3, 10, 5, 11, 8, 4, 6
    c) 1, 7, 9, 2, 3, 10, 5, 11, 8, 4, 6
    d) 1, 7, 2, 9, 3, 10, 5, 11, 8, 4, 6
    e) 1, 2, 9, 7, 3, 4, 10, 5, 6, 11, 8

2. [Topological Sort Implementation](topo_sort.py)

3. [Output of Kahn's Algorithm on Cascadia Web Services graph](topo_sort_typescript) 

4. [A\* implementation](astar.py), [Link to A\* and Dijkstra's output](astar_output)

5. [Kruskal's Implementation](kruskal.py)

6. The new minimal route would save 14 edges, or 10,131.9 miles of track. This is a 24% savings in edges and 
   a 49% savings in mileage. [Link to graphCompare](graphweight_comparison.py) 

   The 14 edges reduces the total edge count form 58 to 44, or n - 1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. 
   This is what is required of a miminum spanning tree. [Link to graphCompare output](graphcomp_output)
